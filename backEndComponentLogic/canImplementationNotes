Use can.notifier for nonblocking

Use can.BufferedReader() to store and listen messages in intervals then output all at once?
    +Stores CAN data if processing is too slow to then be processed later. Idk if it accumulates and overflows later.
    +less CPU load? --> if read every 0.1 seconds.


    Use can.Printer to prototype and test.
